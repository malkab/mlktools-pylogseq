This is an example on how to configure a Python PyPI package for publishing.

The name of the parent folder must match the name of the package, as well as the main folder inside src. Inside that folder the package can be organized in submodules.

# Access PyDoc Documentation

Navigate to the package **src** or **tests** folder and run **python -m pydoc -b**. Do this in the VSC terminal. A browser should open with the documentation.
