- Working in fixing the EYA output (some data items were null) and the CSV export. Making the Docker images more general by depending them on SWARM configs. Dimensioning the beta instance to 32GB RAM, testing. Dumped last version (clean, 13GB) of the beta database at **Dropbox**. Created a new context at **sunnsaas_v1** kepler to test locally. Deployed latest version to beta and relaunched several analysis.
