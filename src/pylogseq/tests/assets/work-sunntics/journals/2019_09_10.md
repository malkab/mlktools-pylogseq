- Another meeting held. The Development Roadmap is most important. Working on the Feasibility UC. Registered new domains for Sunntics at GoDaddy (sunntics.es and sunntics.co.uk). We were unable to make it at Google, don't know the reason.
- Worked a lot on the Feasibility UC again. Lots of insight gained from asking Manolo, also launching tests at sheep. Everything is becoming clearer, although a lot of possibilities are ahead for optimization and paralellization.
