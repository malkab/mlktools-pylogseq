  - How does Python Dash compare to Grafana and Apache Superset? Do they fill the same functional role in an architecture?
    collapsed:: true
    - Python Dash, Grafana, and Apache Superset are all popular tools for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards. However, they have some differences in terms of their focus and functionality.
    - Grafana is primarily a dashboarding tool that provides a powerful and flexible platform for creating and sharing interactive dashboards. It is specifically designed for time-series data and provides a wide range of visualization options, including graphs, charts, and tables. Grafana has a strong emphasis on data exploration, allowing users to quickly filter, drill down, and manipulate data to gain insights.
    - Apache Superset is a business intelligence tool that provides a powerful platform for data exploration and visualization. It is designed to connect to a wide range of data sources, including databases, cloud services, and big data platforms. Superset provides a rich set of visualization options, including charts, graphs, maps, and pivot tables. It also includes a range of features for data exploration, including filtering, drill-down, and ad-hoc queries.
    - Python Dash is a web application framework that allows developers to create interactive dashboards and data visualizations using Python. It is designed to be highly customizable and flexible, allowing developers to create dashboards that meet their specific needs. Python Dash provides a wide range of visualization options, including graphs, charts, and tables, as well as a set of built-in UI components for creating complex layouts.
    - While all three tools can be used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards, they have some differences in terms of their focus and functionality. Grafana is primarily focused on time-series data and provides a powerful platform for data exploration and visualization. Apache Superset is designed for business intelligence and provides a wide range of features for data exploration and visualization. Python Dash is highly customizable and flexible, allowing developers to create dashboards that meet their specific needs.
- [#A] #TL/toolsresearch #TL/sunntics Las memorias de [[TL/010-work/cloudia]] tienen buen material tecnol√≥gico y potencialmente aprovechable, revisar.
- [#A] Revisar las extenciones [[VSC]] en [[helios]] y [[euler]]. #TL/toolsresearch
- [#C] #TL/010-work/sunntics #TL/toolsresearch Hay material interesante sobre [[Kubernetes]] en la memoria de [[TL/010-work/cloudia]] de NTT
- [#A] No tenemos una **Cookiecutter** para WP en los tags de **Dropbox**, ver si esto es necesario.
- [#A] El acceso a nuestro [[AWS]] siempre se hace por medio de root, esto debe cambiar. Volver a revisar el S3, aunque creo que ya lo tenemos limpio.
